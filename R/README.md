### Marketing Mix Model with a nonparametric approach to statistical inference

---

## Introduction

  * **What is dryadMMM**: dryadMMM is a fork of Robyn, the semi-automated and open-sourced Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) package from Meta 
  Marketing Science. It uses various machine learning techniques (Ridge regression, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, time-series decomposition for trend & season, gradient-based optimization for budget allocation etc.) to define media channel efficiency and effectivity, explore adstock rates and saturation curves. It extends Robyn by using a nonparametric approach to statistical inference that relies on large amounts of computation rather than mathematical analysis and distributional assumptions of traditional parametric inference. This approach has been shown to provide asymptotically accurate inferences for a wide variety of statistics.
